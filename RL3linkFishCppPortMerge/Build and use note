1. Download dependence:
libtorch:
https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html

wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/nightly/cpu/libtorch-shared-with-deps-latest.zip
unzip libtorch-shared-with-deps-latest.zip

Eigen (must use 3.4, apt-get now only support 3.3.7):
https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
wget https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.4.0/eigen-3.4.0.tar.bz2

2. build eigen:
go into the directory of Eigen and create a build folder 
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=DIRECTORY_INSTALL ../ (fill this with the directory where you want to put Eigen)

3. build our project:
go to RL3linkFishCppPortMerge folder

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/absolute/path/to/libtorch;PATH_TO_EIGEN" ..
cmake --build . --config Release
or
cmake --build . --config Debug

3.1 build on CARC 
module load gcc/8.3.0 
module load openmpi/4.0.2
module load cmake
export LD_PRELOAD=/spack/apps/gcc/8.3.0/lib64/libstdc++.so.6

build:

cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/absolute/path/to/libtorch;PATH_TO_EIGEN"  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc   -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++   ..


4. running:
mpirun -n 4 ./example-app  > out   
in which 4 is the amount of nodes you want to use 
(> out) means everything which are supposed to be printed in terminal is instead printed in a file called out
